# ISL-python
This repository contains Python code for tables/figures from the book 'An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R' by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani (2013).<P>
This great book gives a thorough introduction to the field of Statistical/Machine Learning. It is available for download (see below), but for me this is one those books that is definitely worth buying. The book contains sections with applications in R based on public datasets available for download or which are part of the R-package ISLR. Since Python is my language of choice for data analysis, I decided to try and rework some of the figures and calculations in IPython Notebook using:

<UL>
<LI>pandas
<LI>numpy
<LI>statsmodels
<LI>scikit-learn
<LI>matplotlib
<LI>seaborn
</UL>

I am new to the ML field and a Python novice, but I thought it to be a good way to learn more about both by creating these notebooks. I created some of the figures/tables of the chapters and worked through some LAB sections. I realize that at certain points it may look like I tried too hard to make the output identical to the tables and R-plots in the book. But I did this to explore some details of the libraries mentioned above (mostly matplotlib).<BR> Suggestions for improvement and help with unsolved issues are welcome!<P>
