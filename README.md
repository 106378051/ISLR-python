# ISL-python
This repository will contain Python code for tables/figures from the book 'An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R' by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani (2013).<P>
This great book gives a thorough introduction to the field of Statistical/Machine Learning. It is available for download (see below), but for me this is one those books that is definitely worth buying. The book contains sections with applications in R based on datasets provided for download or which are part of the ISLR R-package. But since python is my language of choice for data analysis, I decided to rework some of the figures and calculations in Python.
